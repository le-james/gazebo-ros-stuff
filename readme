All my custom plugins

Each plugin are created in their respective folders in the my_gazebo_plugins folder

Need to export the path to the models and plugins folders using the commands below:
	export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=~/.gazebo/models:$GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH
	export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=~/Documents/my_gazebo_plugins/plugins/:$GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH
	
For testing purposes so I don't have to keep moving the .so file to the /plugins folder
	export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=~/Documents/my_gazebo_plugins/<TEST_PLUGIN_FOLDER>/build/:$GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH

To see the exported paths use the command: 
	printenv
	
To delete an exported path use the command:
	unset <export path name>
